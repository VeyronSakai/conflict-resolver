# Git Conflict Resolver Configuration Example
# This file defines rules for automatically resolving Git conflicts

rules:
  # Always use theirs for package-lock.json
  # This is useful when you want to accept incoming changes for dependency lock files
  - path: 'package-lock.json'
    strategy: 'theirs'

  # Always use theirs for yarn.lock
  - path: 'yarn.lock'
    strategy: 'theirs'

  # Always use ours for auto-generated files
  - path: '*.generated.ts'
    strategy: 'ours'

  - path: '*.generated.js'
    strategy: 'ours'

  # For build output directories, always use ours
  - path: 'dist/**/*'
    strategy: 'ours'

  - path: 'build/**/*'
    strategy: 'ours'

  # Example with conflictType specification
  # Only apply this rule when both sides modified the file
  - path: 'src/**/*.test.ts'
    conflictType: 'both-modified'
    strategy: 'theirs'

  # Another example with conflictType
  # When a file is added by both sides, prefer theirs
  - path: 'docs/**/*.md'
    conflictType: 'both-added'
    strategy: 'theirs'

  # Configuration files - be careful with these
  # You might want to manually resolve conflicts in config files
  # Uncomment if you want automatic resolution:
  # - path: ".github/workflows/*.yml"
  #   strategy: "theirs"

  # Database migration files - usually want to keep both
  # This example shows preferring 'ours' for migrations
  # - path: "migrations/*.sql"
  #   conflictType: "both-added"
  #   strategy: "ours"
# Notes:
# - Rules are evaluated in order. The first matching rule wins.
# - 'path' supports glob patterns (e.g., *.js, src/**/*.ts)
# - 'strategy' must be either 'ours' or 'theirs'
# - 'conflictType' is optional. If not specified, the rule applies to all conflict types.
# - Valid conflictType values:
#   - 'both-modified' (UU): Both sides modified the file
#   - 'both-added' (AA): Both sides added the same file
#   - 'both-deleted' (DD): Both sides deleted the file
#   - 'added-by-us' (AU): We added, they modified
#   - 'added-by-them' (UA): They added, we modified
#   - 'deleted-by-us' (DU): We deleted, they modified
#   - 'deleted-by-them' (UD): They deleted, we modified
